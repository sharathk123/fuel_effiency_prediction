# Fuel Efficiency Prediction – Final Report

## 1. ML Model Selected

The selected machine learning model is:

- **RandomForestRegressor** from `sklearn.ensemble`

### Why RandomForest?
- Strong performance on tabular regression data
- Robustness to outliers
- Automatic feature importance estimation

---

## 2. Features Selected

### Numerical Features:
- `range_km`
- `mass_kg`
- `co2_emission_tons`
- `co2_wltp_g_per_km`
- `engine_capacity_cc`
- `engine_power_kw`
- `energy_consumption_whpkm`
- `co2_reduction_wltp_gpkm`
- `electric_range_km`

### Categorical Features:
- `fuel_type`
- `fuel_mix`

*These features were selected based on domain relevance and completeness.*

---

## 3. Feature Importance

The most influential features include:
- `engine_power_kw`
- `co2_wltp_g_per_km`
- `mass_kg`
- `fuel_mix`

## 4. Evaluation of the Model

The model was evaluated using **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **R²** on three dataset splits:

| Dataset        | RMSE | MAE  | R²     |
|----------------|------|------|--------|
| Train          | 0.18 | 0.06 | 0.9245 |
| Validation     | 0.19 | 0.07 | 0.9150 |
| Test (Prod)    | 0.19 | 0.07 | 0.9158 |

*The model generalizes well with consistent performance across all splits.*

---

## 5. Original Code

The codebase includes:

### a. `train_model.py`
- Loads, cleans, preprocesses, trains, and saves the model pipeline.

### b. `predict_model.py`
- Loads the saved model and performs batch predictions on unseen data.

### c. `api/main.py` (FastAPI)
- REST API to serve real-time predictions at the endpoint `/predict`.

---

## 6. Dataset & Artifacts

- **Input Dataset**: `data/Automobile_data.csv`
- **Trained Model Path**: `model/fuel_model.pkl`

---

## ✅ Project Highlights

- Supports both **batch** and **real-time** inference
- Includes preprocessing pipeline using `ColumnTransformer`
- Modular structure for easy extension and deployment

---

## Next Suggestions

- Add correlation heatmaps or residual error plots
- Add Docker support for production deployment
- Implement logging and monitoring with MLflow or Prometheus
